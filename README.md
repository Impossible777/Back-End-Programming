Back-end Programming Project

In this project for school, I was tasked with creating a minimally viable product(MVP) to migrate the legacy back-end of an ecommerce website to a Java/Spring framework. In doing so, I created and implemented RESTFul services using Spring Data KPA and MySQL, ensuring the ability to connect and transfer data with the Angular front-end(Please note that the Angular front-end is not available in this repository).Additionally, a checkout service interface and implementation class were provided to enable customers to add items to their carts, purchase items, and recieve an order tracking number. All code was written by myself, Michael Crist.
